## Minsung's **Homepage**

[CV](https://cho.minsung.pl/cv/cv.pdf) | [GitHub](https://github.com/minsungc) | minsung AT ccs DOT neu DOT edu

I'm a 2.5th year PhD student at the amazing [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, working with [Steven Holtzen](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/). 

I am an R&D intern at RelationalAI in Summer 2024, working on 
the Rel language and compiler.

I received my BS from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Jeremy Avigad](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/).

My interests are primarily in programming languages. Lately I've been tinkering with continuations and effects with primary application towards modular probabilistic programming. 

I'm also interested in the following things, in no particular order:

* Functional logic programming
* Specialty coffee
* Origami
* Distracting my labmates

I'm a first-generation Korean American. My Erd≈ës number is 5. According to David Savitt's Springer GTM personality quiz, I am Mac Lane's *Categories for the Working Mathematician*.
