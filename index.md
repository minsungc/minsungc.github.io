I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the amazing [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University, working with [Steven Holtzen](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/). 

I received my BS from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Jeremy Avigad](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/).

My interests are primarily in programming languages and artificial intelligence. I build bridges between knowledge compilation and probabilistic program semantics. 

I'm also interested in the following things, in no particular order:

* Algebraic effects
* Interactive theorem proving
* Specialty coffee
* Distracting my labmates with casual conversation

I'm a first-generation Korean American. My Erd≈ës number is 5. According to David Savitt's Springer GTM personality quiz, I am Mac Lane's *Categories for the Working Mathematician*.

### Papers

I have an old paper from undergrad from when I was at the UTC Math REU. It's published in *Opuscula Mathematica*.
