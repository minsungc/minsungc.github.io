<p>I think I&#39;m Korean. Here&#39;s some reasons why, in no particular order. </p>
<p>I speak Korean. I read and write Korean. My English name is a transliteration of my Korean name. All of my extended family are in Korea. I read the Korean news. I like Korean pop culture. Korean food is my comfort food. My country of birth on my passport says &#39;Republic of Korea&#39;. I celebrate Korean holidays. I root for Korea in any tournament they are represented. There&#39;s more, but at some point I&#39;m getting nitpicky.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m American. Here&#39;s some reasons why, in no particular order.</p>
<p>I speak English. I read and write English. I&#39;ve been living in the United States for quite some time now. I read the news in English. I&#39;m familiar with English memes. I&#39;m a US citizen with a US passport. My views on diversity and equity are heavily influenced by my growing up in American society. I celebrate American holidays.</p>
<p>Yet, to the average Korean, I&#39;m not Korean. I have an accent, I didn&#39;t go through the Korean school system, and I never served in the military. And to the average American, I&#39;m not American. I&#39;m not white, my name isn&#39;t occidental, and every once in a while I get called &#39;chink&#39; or &#39;gook&#39;. To me it seems like both cultures equally reject me. So what am I?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. I&#39;m <strong>both Korean and American.</strong> The only factor in my racial identity is how I perceive myself, not how others perceive me. In a more computer science-y sense, racial identity is an analytic concept, not a synthetic one. </p>
<p>Well, isn&#39;t that Korean-American? Meh, it could be. But I dislike using that word because it seems to separate people like me into a third group: the Americans, the Koreans, and the Korean-Americans. That&#39;s awfully disconnected from my own perception of my racial identity, in which I think of myself as in both groups. Of course, your perception of this word can be different. No, I don&#39;t want to debate it. </p>
