<h3>“Maybe ‘we’ is something that comes into being by saying it over and
over.” – Franny Choi</h3>
<p>Everyone has their own story about their journey through mental
health. Here is mine.</p>
<pre><code>I have pretty bad anxiety and mild ADHD. I thought it was depression but I got rediagnosed.

It has been 2.5 years since I realized I can&#39;t get myself to do anything.

Two years since I took my first SSRI. One year since I stopped.

Four months since I couldn&#39;t leave my house for six weeks.

Three months since I started NDRIs.

Only three weeks since I started therapy again.</code></pre>
<p>I really don’t think my story is very original. If anything the only
original thing about my story is that it is my own lived experience. But
the whole misdiagnosis thing, the medication, the therapy–people have
been through this.</p>
<p>I also don’t think I’m being very original when I say that my mental
health struggle has been lonely. No one’s ever really reached out and held my hand; I sought out professional help by myself. That’s alright. I
never really was the one to be vulnerable anyways. I’m working on
that.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not being original when I say that being Korean and a
guy does not really help with the loneliness. Deprogramming myself from
masking as an emotionless forward facing robot destined for “success”
(whatever the fuck that means) has been a journey in and of itself.</p>
<p>But I find comfort in my unoriginality. I find comfort that there are
people, the vast majority of whom I don’t know, who feel the same
feelings that I do. Who live different lives but walk the same path I am. Who work different jobs but fish in the same river.</p>
<p>And what is that if not “we”? That is what I’m celebrating today. We
who are out there, unoriginal, each trying to live our original lives
while dealing with whatever is going on up there. And I might not understand
your struggle, and you may not understand mine, but we understand
struggle. Cheers to that.</p>
