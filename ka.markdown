## Analytic vs. synthetic racial identity

I think I'm Korean. Here's some reasons why, in no particular order. 

I speak Korean. I read and write Korean. My English name is a transliteration of my Korean name. All of my extended family are in Korea. I read the Korean news. I like Korean pop culture. Korean food is my comfort food. My country of birth on my passport says 'Republic of Korea'. I celebrate Korean holidays. I root for Korea in any tournament they are represented. There's more, but at some point I'm getting nitpicky.

I think I'm American. Here's some reasons why, in no particular order.

I speak English. I read and write English. I've been living in the United States for quite some time now. I read the news in English. I'm familiar with English memes. I'm a US citizen with a US passport. My views on diversity and equity are heavily influenced by my growing up in American society. I celebrate American holidays.

Yet, to the average Korean, I'm not Korean. I have an accent, I didn't go through the Korean school system, and I never served in the military. And to the average American, I'm not American. I'm not white, my name isn't occidental, and every once in a while I get called 'chink' or 'gook'. To me it seems like both cultures equally reject me. So what am I?

The answer is simple. I'm **both Korean and American.** The only factor in my racial identity is how I perceive myself, not how others perceive me. In a more computer science-y sense, racial identity is an analytic problem, not a synthetic one. 

Well, isn't that Korean-American? Meh, it could be. But I dislike using that word because it seems to separate people like me into a third group: the Americans, the Koreans, and the Korean-Americans. That's awfully disconnected from my own perception of my racial identity, in which I think of myself as in both groups. Of course, your perception of this word can be different. No, I don't want to debate it.
