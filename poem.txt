Search for lunch, or: a third space

Half past lunchtime. I sit in the
Young Adult section of some bookstore
I've never been in before.
Diaries of Wimpy Kids and Chronicles of Warriors.
My stomach grumbles; a text:
"Sorry, just woke up".

My mother--not knowing English
but thinking I should learn--
drove our America-sized minivan twenty minutes to 
some dingy mall where I had my fill of
weird words and chapter books.
Barns and Nobles.

I walk out with some poems as takeaway;
I forget to tip. But I still feel hungry
so I walk, headphones in, 
to this really cool dim sum place
I thought of checking out. A new text:
"Be there in an hour"
