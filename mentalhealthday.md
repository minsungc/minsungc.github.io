"Maybe 'we' is something that comes into being by saying it over and over." -- Franny Choi

Everyone has their own story about their journey through mental health. Here is mine.

```
I have pretty bad anxiety and mild ADHD. I thought it was depression but I got rediagnosed.

It has been 2.5 years since I realized I can't get myself to do anything.

Two years since I took my first SSRI. One year since I stopped.

Four months since I couldn't leave my house for six weeks.

Three months since I started NDRIs.

Only three weeks since I started therapy again.
```

I really don't think my story is very original. If anything the only original thing about my story is that it is my own lived experience. But the whole misdiagnosis thing, the medication, the therapy--people have been through this.

I also don't think I'm being very original when I say that my mental health struggle has been lonely. No one's ever reached out to ask if I was OK; I sought out professional help by myself. That's alright. I never really was the one to be vulnerable anyways. I'm working on that.

I'm definitely not being original when I say that being Korean and a guy does not really help with the loneliness. Deprogramming myself from masking as an emotionless forward facing robot destined for "success" (whatever the fuck that means) has been a journey in and of itself.

But I find comfort in my unoriginality. I find comfort that there are people, the vast majority of which I don't know, who feel the same feelings that I do. Who live different lives but share parts of my struggle. Who work different jobs but reflect on the same things I do.

And what is that if not "we"? That is what I'm celebrating today. We who are out there, unoriginal, each trying to live our original lives while dealing with whatever is going on up there.
