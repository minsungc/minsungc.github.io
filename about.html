        I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Research Lab</a> at Northeastern University, advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Holtzen</a>.

        I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in mathematics and philosophy, concentrating in logic. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Avigad</a>.

        My research is in programming languages and artificial intelligence. I make bridges between efficient probabilistic reasoning via knowledge compilation and the rich, rigid semantics offered by probabilistic programming languages. I'm also interested in type systems and formalized mathematics, mostly via Lean.

        In a past life, I wanted to become a functional analyst. I have a <a href="https://www.opuscula.agh.edu.pl/vol41/6/art/opuscula_math_4138.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a> from this time with Seth Hoisington, Brian Udall, and Roger Nichols, when I was at the UTC Math REU.
