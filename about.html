        I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu">Programming Research Lab</a> at Northeastern University, advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/">Steven Holtzen</a>.

        I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in mathematics and philosophy, concentrating in logic. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/">Jeremy Avigad</a>.

        My research is in programming languages and artificial intelligence. I use tools from automated reasoning to make new, efficient probabilistic inference algorithms, which most often manifest as a domain-specific language. I'm also interested in type systems and formalized mathematics, mostly via Lean.

        In a past life, I wanted to become a functional analyst. I have a <a href="https://www.opuscula.agh.edu.pl/vol41/6/art/opuscula_math_4138.pdf">publication</a> from this time with Seth Hoisington, Brian Udall, and Roger Nichols, when I was at the UTC Math REU.
