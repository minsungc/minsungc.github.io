        I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Research Lab</a> at Northeastern University, advised by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Holtzen</a>.

        I received my B.S. at Carnegie Mellon in mathematics and philosophy, concentrating in logic. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Avigad</a>.

        My research is in programming languages and artificial intelligence. I build bridges between two approaches to probabilistic reasoning: the efficient knowledge compilation approach and the feature-rich, safe semantic approach. In some sense I'm working on "compilers for probability theory". I'm also interested in interactive theorem proving, program logics, and their pedagogy.

        In a past life, I wanted to become a functional analyst. I have a <a href="https://www.opuscula.agh.edu.pl/vol41/6/art/opuscula_math_4138.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a> from this time with Seth Hoisington, Brian Udall, and Roger Nichols, when I was at the UTC Math REU.
